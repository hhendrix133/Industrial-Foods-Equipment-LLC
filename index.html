FAVICON FIX FOR GITHUB PAGES
=============================

PROBLEM:
Your HTML file references: images/Favicon.png
But your actual file is: Favicon.jpg

SOLUTION:
In your index.html file, find this line (around line 10):

    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="images/Favicon.png">

Replace it with:

    <link rel="icon" type="image/jpeg" href="images/Favicon.jpg">

That's it! Just change:
- "image/png" → "image/jpeg"  
- "Favicon.png" → "Favicon.jpg"

AFTER UPLOADING TO GITHUB:
After you push this change to GitHub, you may need to do a hard refresh in your browser to see the favicon:
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Safari: Cmd+Option+R

This will clear the browser cache and load the new favicon.

NOTE: GitHub Pages servers are case-sensitive, so make sure the filename in your code exactly matches the actual filename in your images folder (including capitalization).
